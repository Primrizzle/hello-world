# hello-world
My name is Ashley Primrose, but my friends and family call me **Ash**. 

**This is my very first GH repository** 

I am a code explorer, currently attending UT Dallas for my software engingeering degree, and hoping to figure out how I will use my knowledge in my career.
I hope to practice my coding more, and create an informal portfolio for me to reference, get feedback, and improve my skills as a coder. 

As I continue on my path in coding, I also hope to realize my future opportunities for both work and passion projects. I sincerely believe software development and engineering to be an impactful and potentially groundbreaking industry.
